## Introduction

JLox is a dynamically typed garbage collected interpreted language. It is designed solely for educational and learning purpose and is not meant for any real world scripting which requires high performance. Its C-alternative(non-existent for now) is probably a better choice for the same.

JLox has been designed as per Rober Nystrom's [craftinginterpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com) Lox implementation with my [own](https://github.com/RougherO) spin on it and includes as much source code documentation as possible to make it understandable for everyone. As always improvement in documentation is always welcome. Consider opening a PR for the same at [JLox github](https://github.com/RougherO/JLox).
